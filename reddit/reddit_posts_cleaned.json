We order food through delivery apps, buy luxury items on e-commerce sites, listen to podcasts during commutes, check our work email every hour, and fall asleep to mindless video content on autoplay. This relentless integration of technology in modern society gives its purveyors immense power\u2014and we should all be paying attention to where their political allegiances lie.\n\nJeff Bezos, the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of [$233 billion](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/profile\/jeff-bezos\/), is the founder and executive chairman of the $2.3 trillion company Amazon. He also owns the Washington Post, the third-largest U.S. newspaper by both print and digital subscriber count, which he bought in 2013 for $250 million. You may remember that Bezos forbade the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Kamala Harris for president last year, breaking decades of tradition to ostensibly [end](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/jeff-bezos-defends-washington-post-endorsement-decision-rcna177742) \u201ca perception of bias.\u201d Yet, Bezos has made *his preferences* clear via the most powerful force in politics today: money. \n\n* The wealth we\u2019re talking about in this post is literally unimaginable. In [2023](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/jeff-bezos-made-over-7-172628289.html), Bezos made $191,780,822 million a day. That\u2019s $7,990,868 per hour. In just under 13 minutes, he raked in what an average U.S. worker makes in their entire lifetime. Check out [this visualization](https:\/\/eattherichtextformat.github.io\/1-pixel-wealth\/) of Bezos\u2019 wealth (created in 2020, when he was the richest man on earth) to better understand the magnitude of these numbers.\n\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, Bezos-controlled PACs dedicated [two-thirds](https:\/\/united4respect.org\/reports\/amazon-political-spending-2024\/) of their political spending to Republican candidates and PACs that support Republican causes. Once Trump won the election, however, Bezos went all in, giving Trump\u2019s inaugural committee the maximum [$1 million](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trump-tech-ceos-meta-amazon-donate-millions-inauguration\/) donation\u2014more than three times as much as his company contributed to Biden\u2019s inauguration. He then flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump and Elon Musk, right after [telling the media](https:\/\/variety.com\/2024\/biz\/news\/jeff-bezos-work-with-trump-remove-regulations-1236235126\/) that he believes the president-elect has \u201cgrown in the past eight years\u201d and expressing hope that Trump will \u201creduce regulation.\u201d \n\n>\u201cI\u2019m actually very optimistic this time around,\u201d Bezos said of Trump at the DealBook conference. \u201cHe seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help him do that, I\u2019m gonna help him.\u201d\n\nOf course, the regulations Bezos refers to are all common sense limits on corporate power, like those imposed by OSHA to ensure a safe workplace, EPA rules to protect the environment, and NLRB shields for the right to unionize. Removing these regulations would greatly benefit Bezos\u2019 companies, boosting his and his shareholders\u2019 profits.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the third-richest person in the world with a net worth of $212 billion, has also made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring of the president-elect. Shortly after the election, Zuckerberg flew on his private jet to dine with Trump, where the two [reportedly](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-mar-a-lago-meta\/) discussed the administration\u2019s economic plans. He [returned](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/trump-zuckerberg-meet-mar-a-lago-semafor-reports-2025-01-11\/) a second time just last week after committing to give $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. In contrast, Meta did not donate to Biden\u2019s inauguration.\n\nLeaders of other big tech companies to give the maximum $1 million contribution to Trump\u2019s coronation include Apple CEO Tim Cook (who did not give to Biden\u2019s), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (who did not give to Biden\u2019s), Google (which gave $337,000 to Biden\u2019s), and Microsoft (which gave $500,000 to Biden\u2019s). Their donations, in addition to millions given by corporations like Toyota and Lockheed Martin, have made Trump\u2019s 2025 inaugural committee the most successful in history with more than [$170 million](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/09\/politics\/trump-inaugural-committee-raised-170-million\/index.html) raised so far. In fact, the committee is so flush with cash that it is [limiting](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/jan\/13\/trump-vance-access-cost-inauguration) VIP access to those who donated $1 million and directing anyone who wishes to give less than $500,000 to instead donate to Trump-allied PACs.\n\nThese large donations are essentially bribes. Business leaders, correctly judging Trump to be [easily manipulated](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/article\/2024\/aug\/21\/trump-putin-hr-mcmaster-memoir) by flattery and appeals to his ego, have launched an all-out charm offensive. Bezos\u2019 trips to Mar-a-Lago and unprecedented financial support are an attempt to buy advantageous policy decisions in the future\u2014like the potential abandonment of an [FTC antitrust lawsuit](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/us-antitrust-case-against-amazon-move-forward-2024-10-07\/) against Amazon\u2014and avoid Trump\u2019s vengeance for past perceived harms\u2014like the [lawsuit](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/amazon-lost-10b-pentagon-contract-trumps-personal-vendetta\/story?id=67606505) Bezos filed over a $10 billion Department of Defense cloud computing contract that Trump awarded to Microsoft, not Amazon. He also likely fears that Elon Musk\u2019s apparent closeness with Trump will result in preferential treatment of SpaceX, a competitor of Bezos\u2019 aerospace company Blue Origin.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is likewise bending the knee to ingratiate himself with Trump, hoping the incoming administration won\u2019t harm his profits. During a recent [appearance](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7k1ehaE0bdU) on the Joe Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg provided a laundry list of issues that Trump could help with, including keeping domestic artificial intelligence regulation from slowing his company\u2019s attempt to catch up with OpenAI (whose CEO, Sam Altman, also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration) and dissuading other countries from policing his platforms.\n\n>Zuckerberg [complained](https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/zuckerberg-urges-trump-to-stop-eu-from-screwing-with-fining-us-tech-companies\/) that the EU had forced U.S. tech companies operating in Europe to pay \"more than $30 billion\" in penalties for legal violations over the past two decades. Last November, the tech chief's Meta conglomerate, which operates Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media and communications platforms, was fined \u20ac797 million for breaching EU antitrust rules by imposing unfair trading conditions on ads service providers.\n\n>Zuckerberg argued that the European Commission's application of competition rules is \"almost like a tariff\" on American tech companies and said that U.S. President Joe Biden's outgoing administration had failed to deal with the situation\u2026\n\n>\"And it's one of the things that I'm optimistic about with President Trump,\" he added. The U.S. president-elect appeared on the same program on the eve of November's American presidential election and cited Rogan's endorsement as a factor in his support among voters. \"I think he just wants America to win,\" Zuckerberg said about Trump.\n\nOne of the EU\u2019s laws that Zuckerberg is likely to run afoul of is the Digital Services Act, which aims to curb misformation. Last week, Zuckerberg announced that he is ending fact-checking on Meta\u2019s platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, [calling](https:\/\/variety.com\/2025\/digital\/news\/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-meta-fact-checking-ban-1236271925\/) the practice a \u201cslippery slope\u201d that became \u201ctoo politically biased.\u201d This, too, is another move to [obey in advance](https:\/\/www.democracynow.org\/2024\/12\/20\/trump_defamation_suits). Trump has long threatened to use the power of the government to [\u201cdestroy\u201d](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-12-15\/trump-targets-social-media-censorship-in-2024-themed-unveiling?embedded-checkout=true) social media companies that he believes \u201ccensor\u201d conservative viewpoints, even [signing](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/05\/28\/863932758\/stung-by-twitter-trump-signs-executive-order-to-weaken-social-media-companies) an executive order during his final year in office that would have weakened protections for platforms and websites. Whether to avoid a messy legal fight with Trump, or because he truly believed in the rightwing culture war messaging all along, Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta will now [allow](https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2025\/01\/09\/facebook-instagram-meta-hate-speech-content-moderation\/) users to use hate speech based on racial, ethnic, and gender identities:\n\n>Examples of newly permissible speech on Facebook and Instagram highlighted in the training materials include:\n\n>\u201cImmigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of shit.\u201d\n\n>\u201cGays are freaks.\u201d\n\n>\u201cLook at that tranny (beneath photo of 17 year old girl).\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s changes will ultimately turn the discourse on Facebook and Instagram into near-clones of Twitter\/X, owned by Trump\u2019s un-elected co-president Elon Musk. The danger of unrestricted misinformation spreading within a rightwing mediasphere should be fresh in our minds: \n\n* Last fall, FEMA workers were [threatened](https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/fema-north-carolina-disinformation-threats-militia-c1595fef596d0f78638ba4177bfa76af) by individuals who believed false rumors that the Biden administration diverted Hurricane Helene disaster money to immigrants. Elon Musk [tweeted](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2024\/10\/08\/elon-musk-hurricane-disinformation-trump-00182769) that \u201cFEMA used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives. Treason.\u201d\n\n* Haitian immigrants in Ohio were [targeted](https:\/\/time.com\/7034714\/springfield-haitians-history\/) by a racist misinformation campaign claiming that they kill and eat local pets, inspiring a wave of [bomb threats](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2024\/09\/19\/nx-s1-5114047\/springfield-ohio-haitian-migrants-trump-safety-concerns) that closed schools and government buildings. Elon Musk even [reposted](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2024\/03\/14\/elon-musk-haiti-crisis-video-cannibalism) a video implying that Haitian immigrants are cannibals.\n\n* Just last week, far-right agitators seized on the wildfires in California to push [conspiracy theories](https:\/\/imgur.com\/RVInGhm) that Democratic leaders and\/or \u201cglobalists\u201d intentionally disabled firefighting efforts for their own benefit. Others [blamed](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/jan\/10\/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire) \u201cDEI hire[s],\u201d a common racist and misogynist dogwhistle, for incompetent leadership, with Elon Musk [tweeting](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/conormurray\/2025\/01\/09\/elon-musk-and-more-right-wing-critics-blame-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-for-la-wildfires-with-little-evidence\/), \u201cDEI means people DIE.\u201d\n\nFar from what these rightwing agitators would have us believe, immigration and diversity are not a threat.

Contrary to what Hank and his Grasping Harpy would have the rest of the world believe, America can't stand these two F*cking Grifters. \n\nSome snippets:\n\n> \u201cThe thing you\u2019re escaping is the reason you\u2019re compelling.\u201d The killer line comes a third of the way through\u00a0Vanity Fair\u2019s 8,000-word\u00a0Meghan and Harry\u00a0annihilation. It\u2019s the only line that matters, when all is said and done \u2013 and five years on, we must be nearing that moment.\n\n> But when it comes to summing up exactly where things began to unravel for the Duke and Duchess of Delusion\u2019s American dream, it would be hard to beat that single sentence.\n\n> That lack of self-awareness is at the root of the Sussexes\u2019 long list of failures, laid out in all their inglorious detail in the same influential US publication that once treated Meghan like Princess Diana II. It\u2019s all there, from the couple\u2019s embarrassing \u201cnaivety\u201d and their seeming failure to come up with their own ideas or yield interesting content for Spotify to their\u00a0widely derided Netflix series.\n\n> Only here\u2019s the thing: America fell out of love with Meghan and Harry a long time ago. And I say that as someone who lives there half the year and has watched it happen.\n\n> And maybe all that would have been forgiven if the pair produced something of note. Something of quality. They do love grafters out there. But instead, they decided to peddle their grievances.

You, the patron saint of bad decisions, who waded into a relationship with a man while his partner was pregnant. You, who made this bizarre tango with cheaters and liars your personal brand, and then doubled down by bringing another child into the mix with a man who could barely keep his pants zipped long enough to finish a cocktail. Tristan Thompson didn\u2019t just cheat once or twice; he practically made it a hobby, and you, Khlo\u00e9, stayed for the encore. \n\nThe audacity to lecture anyone on leadership or morality while tap-dancing in this circus is nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: you, a fully grown adult, taking a flamethrower to Jordyn Woods\u2014a teenager at the time\u2014and branding her as the destroyer of your family. This, while your darling Tristan was out sowing chaos like some kind of deranged Johnny Appleseed of infidelity. You blamed her because it was easier, because it fed your PR machine, and because that\u2019s what the Kardashians do: devour the vulnerable to keep the machine humming.\n\nThen there\u2019s your DUI arrest, which would have been a scandal for anyone without a war chest of lawyers and a last name synonymous with tabloid immunity. But that was just a warm-up, wasn\u2019t it? Because what followed was years of filtered faces, cartoonish body modifications, and those sanctimonious Instagram platitudes about \u201cself-love\u201d that you hawk like snake oil, even as you morph into a new person every 72 hours under the scalpel of your photo-editing app.\n\nAnd pretending you \u201cjust had a nose job\u201d? Babe, the joke\u2019s on you. We\u2019ve seen the pictures. We\u2019ve seen the layers of reinvention. There\u2019s no shame in owning it, but the gaslighting is almost as laughable as the results.\n\nAnd taxes? Don\u2019t get me started. You dodge them with the elegance of a billionaire ballet, funneling funds through your mother\u2019s pseudo-church\u2014a sham dressed up in the glitter of piety, all while the city you now mock crumbles under the weight of systemic neglect fueled by people like you who refuse to pay their fair share.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that podcast, too. You sat down with Scott Disick, the human embodiment of apathy and excess, and made it sound like a public service. A masterclass in what, exactly? How to coast through life as an empty vessel? A tutorial on how to swindle airtime with nothing to say?\n\nAnd now, in the midst of chaos and calamity, you\u2019re suddenly the voice of the people? Please. If there\u2019s one thing that rivals your ignorance, it\u2019s your audacity. The joke, Khlo\u00e9, isn\u2019t the Mayor of LA.

The joke isn\u2019t the Mayor. The joke is you, Khlo\u00e9: the filtered, Photoshopped, tax-dodging messiah of misdirected outrage.\n\nIf Khlo\u00e9 wants to call someone a joke, perhaps she should take a good, long look in her Instagram mirror\u2014filtered, of course.\n\n","title":"An unapologetic takedown of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s hypocrisy","ups":964,"upvote_ratio":0.98},{"author":"wavyheaded","author_fullname":"t2_ssp9ee7","created_utc":1737,"permalink":"https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/KUWTKsnark\/comments\/1i4bq0r\/three_flights_in_one_day_since_the_wildfires\/","name":"t3_1i4bq0r","subreddit_id":"t5_5mhcrd","subreddit":"KUWTKsnark","num_crossposts":0,"num_comments":62,"score":967,"selftext":"Edit: deleted link","title":"Three flights in one day since the wildfires started?!!! - Kylie Jenner slammed over LA wildfires post hours after her $70million jet made 11th flight in two weeks - and third in one day. - About bloody time this was said in the media, it's not talked about nearly enough","ups":967,"upvote_ratio":1.0},{"author":"iratrabajar","author_fullname":"t2_cbq9r","created_utc":1737,"permalink":"https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/SanDiegan\/comments\/1i73dbu\/appreciation_post_to_the_sd_fire_department_as_i\/","name":"t3_1i73dbu","subreddit_id":"t5_3f157","subreddit":"SanDiegan","num_crossposts":0,"num_comments":25,"score":964,"selftext":"I have lived in San Diego all of my life and I have never had to evacuate from a fire before.

These artists played short sets of one to three songs at two venues, Intuit Dome and the Kia Forum, simultaneously.\n\n> The funds raised came from ticket sales for both venues, sponsorships, merchandise sales and donations from the public including from the Azoff family, the Eagles, Andrew Hauptman and Ellen Bronfman Hauptman and U2. Steve and Connie Ballmer also matched every pledge made during the broadcast and VOD viewing of FireAid while Live Nation served as the production partner.\n\n> FireAid funds will support the Los Angeles-region\u2019s immediate needs and long-term recovery from the recent wildfires. Those still interested in donating to FireAid can do so at FireAidLA.org.","title":"FireAid Has Raised More Than $100 Million So Far for L.A.
