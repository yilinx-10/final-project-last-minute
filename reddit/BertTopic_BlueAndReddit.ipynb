Much like Australia, California burns almost every year.\\n\\nWe hit October or November and you can all but guarantee there's a bushfire somewhere in Aus. Then we get things under control just in time for the fires to start up on the other side of the world, then they get it under control and the cycle repeats.\\n\\nIt's become such a normal part of our year that every cycle we will send fire fighters and resources to California in their summer and they return in kind during ours.\\n\\nBut this most recent wildfire in California is out of season and the tenuous control that we've had over things is as risk as a result.\\n\\nThe sharing of resources helped us control these events, but when we need firefighters the most, so does California and if the same thing happens during our winter, we could start losing even more homes and forests than we already do each year.\\n\\nBushfires becoming more common is a scary future, but bushfires appearing all year long may be more than we can handle.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I’ve been seeing a lot of discourse online about people going to restaurants or shopping or to other events while the city is quite literally on fire. I just wanted to say PLEASE keep doing so. As a person who grew up in Los Angeles and worked in hospitality in Malibu throughout covid and multiple wildfires, your support means everything to us! Don’t feel guilty for going out during such an awful time. Support local businesses and “nonessential” workers in our city!\\n\\nIf the academy is reading this means The Oscars to. All the hotel, food and event staff need your business during this time. I think The Oscars brings in around $200 million for LA and we need that revenue to recover. \\n\\nIf you can afford to go out please do, but don’t forget to tip well!\\n\\nEdit: If this isn’t obvious, the post was intended for those not effected by the fires. If you’ve lost your house or were forced to evacuate obviously I’m not shaming you for not going out. If you were not affected I’m just making the point that you shouldn’t feel bad for going out. Many of us have no choice but to keep going to our minimum wage jobs and rely on your business, especially gig workers without a salary. Getting tipped out at the end of the night will be more helpful than waiting a few weeks for a government stimulus. $10 now is the difference between getting gas or not getting gas. ',\n",

We order food through delivery apps, buy luxury items on e-commerce sites, listen to podcasts during commutes, check our work email every hour, and fall asleep to mindless video content on autoplay. This relentless integration of technology in modern society gives its purveyors immense power—and we should all be paying attention to where their political allegiances lie.\\n\\nJeff Bezos, the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of [$233 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/), is the founder and executive chairman of the $2.3 trillion company Amazon. He also owns the Washington Post, the third-largest U.S. newspaper by both print and digital subscriber count, which he bought in 2013 for $250 million. You may remember that Bezos forbade the Washington Post’s editorial board from endorsing Kamala Harris for president last year, breaking decades of tradition to ostensibly [end](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeff-bezos-defends-washington-post-endorsement-decision-rcna177742) “a perception of bias.” Yet, Bezos has made *his preferences* clear via the most powerful force in politics today: money. \\n\\n* The wealth we’re talking about in this post is literally unimaginable. In [2023](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-made-over-7-172628289.html), Bezos made $191,780,822 million a day. That’s $7,990,868 per hour. In just under 13 minutes, he raked in what an average U.S. worker makes in their entire lifetime. Check out [this visualization](https://eattherichtextformat.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) of Bezos’ wealth (created in 2020, when he was the richest man on earth) to better understand the magnitude of these numbers.\\n\\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, Bezos-controlled PACs dedicated [two-thirds](https://united4respect.org/reports/amazon-political-spending-2024/) of their political spending to Republican candidates and PACs that support Republican causes. Once Trump won the election, however, Bezos went all in, giving Trump’s inaugural committee the maximum [$1 million](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tech-ceos-meta-amazon-donate-millions-inauguration/) donation—more than three times as much as his company contributed to Biden’s inauguration. He then flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump and Elon Musk, right after [telling the media](https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/jeff-bezos-work-with-trump-remove-regulations-1236235126/) that he believes the president-elect has “grown in the past eight years” and expressing hope that Trump will “reduce regulation.” \\n\\n>“I’m actually very optimistic this time around,” Bezos said of Trump at the DealBook conference. “He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help him do that, I’m gonna help him.”\\n\\nOf course, the regulations Bezos refers to are all common sense limits on corporate power, like those imposed by OSHA to ensure a safe workplace, EPA rules to protect the environment, and NLRB shields for the right to unionize. Removing these regulations would greatly benefit Bezos’ companies, boosting his and his shareholders’ profits.\\n\\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the third-richest person in the world with a net worth of $212 billion, has also made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring of the president-elect. Shortly after the election, Zuckerberg flew on his private jet to dine with Trump, where the two [reportedly](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-mar-a-lago-meta/) discussed the administration’s economic plans. He [returned](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-zuckerberg-meet-mar-a-lago-semafor-reports-2025-01-11/) a second time just last week after committing to give $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee. In contrast, Meta did not donate to Biden’s inauguration.\\n\\nLeaders of other big tech companies to give the maximum $1 million contribution to Trump’s coronation include Apple CEO Tim Cook (who did not give to Biden’s), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (who did not give to Biden’s), Google (which gave $337,000 to Biden’s), and Microsoft (which gave $500,000 to Biden’s). Their donations, in addition to millions given by corporations like Toyota and Lockheed Martin, have made Trump’s 2025 inaugural committee the most successful in history with more than [$170 million](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/politics/trump-inaugural-committee-raised-170-million/index.html) raised so far. In fact, the committee is so flush with cash that it is [limiting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/trump-vance-access-cost-inauguration) VIP access to those who donated $1 million and directing anyone who wishes to give less than $500,000 to instead donate to Trump-allied PACs.\\n\\nThese large donations are essentially bribes. Business leaders, correctly judging Trump to be [easily manipulated](https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/21/trump-putin-hr-mcmaster-memoir) by flattery and appeals to his ego, have launched an all-out charm offensive. Bezos’ trips to Mar-a-Lago and unprecedented financial support are an attempt to buy advantageous policy decisions in the future—like the potential abandonment of an [FTC antitrust lawsuit](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-antitrust-case-against-amazon-move-forward-2024-10-07/) against Amazon—and avoid Trump’s vengeance for past perceived harms—like the [lawsuit](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-lost-10b-pentagon-contract-trumps-personal-vendetta/story?id=67606505) Bezos filed over a $10 billion Department of Defense cloud computing contract that Trump awarded to Microsoft, not Amazon. He also likely fears that Elon Musk’s apparent closeness with Trump will result in preferential treatment of SpaceX, a competitor of Bezos’ aerospace company Blue Origin.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg is likewise bending the knee to ingratiate himself with Trump, hoping the incoming administration won’t harm his profits. During a recent [appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1ehaE0bdU) on the Joe Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg provided a laundry list of issues that Trump could help with, including keeping domestic artificial intelligence regulation from slowing his company’s attempt to catch up with OpenAI (whose CEO, Sam Altman, also donated to Trump’s inauguration) and dissuading other countries from policing his platforms.\\n\\n>Zuckerberg [complained](https://www.politico.eu/article/zuckerberg-urges-trump-to-stop-eu-from-screwing-with-fining-us-tech-companies/) that the EU had forced U.S. tech companies operating in Europe to pay \"more than $30 billion\" in penalties for legal violations over the past two decades. Last November, the tech chief\\'s Meta conglomerate, which operates Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media and communications platforms, was fined €797 million for breaching EU antitrust rules by imposing unfair trading conditions on ads service providers.\\n\\n>Zuckerberg argued that the European Commission\\'s application of competition rules is \"almost like a tariff\" on American tech companies and said that U.S. President Joe Biden\\'s outgoing administration had failed to deal with the situation…\\n\\n>\"And it\\'s one of the things that I\\'m optimistic about with President Trump,\" he added. The U.S. president-elect appeared on the same program on the eve of November\\'s American presidential election and cited Rogan\\'s endorsement as a factor in his support among voters. \"I think he just wants America to win,\" Zuckerberg said about Trump.\\n\\nOne of the EU’s laws that Zuckerberg is likely to run afoul of is the Digital Services Act, which aims to curb misformation. Last week, Zuckerberg announced that he is ending fact-checking on Meta’s platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, [calling](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-meta-fact-checking-ban-1236271925/) the practice a “slippery slope” that became “too politically biased.” This, too, is another move to [obey in advance](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/12/20/trump_defamation_suits). Trump has long threatened to use the power of the government to [“destroy”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/trump-targets-social-media-censorship-in-2024-themed-unveiling?embedded-checkout=true) social media companies that he believes “censor” conservative viewpoints, even [signing](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863932758/stung-by-twitter-trump-signs-executive-order-to-weaken-social-media-companies) an executive order during his final year in office that would have weakened protections for platforms and websites. Whether to avoid a messy legal fight with Trump, or because he truly believed in the rightwing culture war messaging all along, Zuckerberg’s Meta will now [allow](https://theintercept.com/2025/01/09/facebook-instagram-meta-hate-speech-content-moderation/) users to use hate speech based on racial, ethnic, and gender identities:\\n\\n>Examples of newly permissible speech on Facebook and Instagram highlighted in the training materials include:\\n\\n>“Immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of shit.”\\n\\n>“Gays are freaks.”\\n\\n>“Look at that tranny (beneath photo of 17 year old girl).”\\n\\nMeta’s changes will ultimately turn the discourse on Facebook and Instagram into near-clones of Twitter/X, owned by Trump’s un-elected co-president Elon Musk. The danger of unrestricted misinformation spreading within a rightwing mediasphere should be fresh in our minds: \\n\\n* Last fall, FEMA workers were [threatened](https://apnews.com/article/fema-north-carolina-disinformation-threats-militia-c1595fef596d0f78638ba4177bfa76af) by individuals who believed false rumors that the Biden administration diverted Hurricane Helene disaster money to immigrants. Elon Musk [tweeted](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/08/elon-musk-hurricane-disinformation-trump-00182769) that “FEMA used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives. Treason.”\\n\\n* Haitian immigrants in Ohio were [targeted](https://time.com/7034714/springfield-haitians-history/) by a racist misinformation campaign claiming that they kill and eat local pets, inspiring a wave of [bomb threats](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/nx-s1-5114047/springfield-ohio-haitian-migrants-trump-safety-concerns) that closed schools and government buildings. Elon Musk even [reposted](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/14/elon-musk-haiti-crisis-video-cannibalism) a video implying that Haitian immigrants are cannibals.\\n\\n* Just last week, far-right agitators seized on the wildfires in California to push [conspiracy theories](https://imgur.com/RVInGhm) that Democratic leaders and/or “globalists” intentionally disabled firefighting efforts for their own benefit. Others [blamed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire) “DEI hire[s],” a common racist and misogynist dogwhistle, for incompetent leadership, with Elon Musk [tweeting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/01/09/elon-musk-and-more-right-wing-critics-blame-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-for-la-wildfires-with-little-evidence/), “DEI means people DIE.”\\n\\nFar from what these rightwing agitators would have us believe, immigration and diversity are not a threat. The threat we should all care about will be [seated together](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343918/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-and-mark-zuckerberg-will-all-sit-together-at-donald-trumps-inauguration) on the dais at Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, the three wealthiest people in the world, collectively worth nearly $900 billion: the new American oligarchy.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAdditional reading:\\n\\n* Meta and Amazon scale back diversity initiatives, [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmy7xpw3pyo)\\n\\n* Meta blocked teens from seeing LGBTQ+ content on Instagram, [The Advocate](https://www.advocate.com/news/instagram-blocked-teens-lgbtq)\\n\\n* Zuckerberg says most companies need more ‘masculine energy’, [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/01/13/zuckerberg-says-companies-need-more-masculine-energy/)\\n\\n* Meta to fire thousands of staff as Zuckerberg warns of ‘intense year’, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/15/meta-to-fire-thousands-of-staff-mark-zuckerberg-warns-of-intense-year)\\n\\n* Mark Zuckerberg will cohost reception with Republican billionaires for Trump inauguration, [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/trump-zuckerberg-inaugural-reception-gop-billionaire-donors-bb9663cc352b78d89ec927fe65d334bd)\\n\\n* ‘Deeply alarmed’: Washington Post staff request meeting with Jeff Bezos, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jan/15/washington-post-jeff-bezos)\\n\\n* A Pulitzer winner quits \\'Washington Post\\' after a cartoon on Bezos is killed, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5248299/cartoonist-quits-wapo-over-bezos-trump-cartoon-washingtonpost)',\n",

Contrary to what Hank and his Grasping Harpy would have the rest of the world believe, America can\\'t stand these two F*cking Grifters. \\n\\nSome snippets:\\n\\n> “The thing you’re escaping is the reason you’re compelling.” The killer line comes a third of the way through\\xa0Vanity Fair’s 8,000-word\\xa0Meghan and Harry\\xa0annihilation. It’s the only line that matters, when all is said and done – and five years on, we must be nearing that moment.\\n\\n> But when it comes to summing up exactly where things began to unravel for the Duke and Duchess of Delusion’s American dream, it would be hard to beat that single sentence.\\n\\n> That lack of self-awareness is at the root of the Sussexes’ long list of failures, laid out in all their inglorious detail in the same influential US publication that once treated Meghan like Princess Diana II. It’s all there, from the couple’s embarrassing “naivety” and their seeming failure to come up with their own ideas or yield interesting content for Spotify to their\\xa0widely derided Netflix series.\\n\\n> Only here’s the thing: America fell out of love with Meghan and Harry a long time ago. And I say that as someone who lives there half the year and has watched it happen.\\n\\n> And maybe all that would have been forgiven if the pair produced something of note. Something of quality. They do love grafters out there. But instead, they decided to peddle their grievances. And “whiny” just doesn’t cut it in the US – a uniquely forward-facing, snap-yourself-out-of-it country. So when\\xa0Spare\\xa0was published, one LA girlfriend’s reaction to the book described as a “whine tour” by one US publication was: “Why would you choose to live in that space?”\\n\\n> This pile-up of recent takedowns (and let us not forget their wildfire “disaster tourists” backlash too) isn’t so much a reflection of a country disappointed in love as a country baffled by how two people who could have had it all managed to get it so wrong.\\n\\nI mean, how many ways can one say, \"STFU and go away, you useless twunts!\"? Maybe if we said it in ~~Argentinian~~ Spanish? \\n',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Khloé Kardashian, perched high atop her gilded, gaudy mansion in the hills, shrieking about the Mayor of Los Angeles being “a joke” during one of California’s darkest hours, is the kind of unhinged hypocrisy that could make even the most cynical observer choke on their overpriced latte. \\n\\nHere we have a woman who has turned self-delusion into an art form, now throwing stones from her glass house—complete with private jets, filtered selfies, and a well-documented history of dubious morality.\\n\\nThe real joke, dear Khloé, is you. You, the patron saint of bad decisions, who waded into a relationship with a man while his partner was pregnant. You, who made this bizarre tango with cheaters and liars your personal brand, and then doubled down by bringing another child into the mix with a man who could barely keep his pants zipped long enough to finish a cocktail. Tristan Thompson didn’t just cheat once or twice; he practically made it a hobby, and you, Khloé, stayed for the encore. \\n\\nThe audacity to lecture anyone on leadership or morality while tap-dancing in this circus is nothing short of breathtaking.\\n\\nAnd let’s not forget the pièce de résistance: you, a fully grown adult, taking a flamethrower to Jordyn Woods—a teenager at the time—and branding her as the destroyer of your family. This, while your darling Tristan was out sowing chaos like some kind of deranged Johnny Appleseed of infidelity. You blamed her because it was easier, because it fed your PR machine, and because that’s what the Kardashians do: devour the vulnerable to keep the machine humming.\\n\\nThen there’s your DUI arrest, which would have been a scandal for anyone without a war chest of lawyers and a last name synonymous with tabloid immunity. But that was just a warm-up, wasn’t it? Because what followed was years of filtered faces, cartoonish body modifications, and those sanctimonious Instagram platitudes about “self-love” that you hawk like snake oil, even as you morph into a new person every 72 hours under the scalpel of your photo-editing app.\\n\\nAnd pretending you “just had a nose job”? Babe, the joke’s on you. We’ve seen the pictures. We’ve seen the layers of reinvention. There’s no shame in owning it, but the gaslighting is almost as laughable as the results.\\n\\nAnd taxes? Don’t get me started. You dodge them with the elegance of a billionaire ballet, funneling funds through your mother’s pseudo-church—a sham dressed up in the glitter of piety, all while the city you now mock crumbles under the weight of systemic neglect fueled by people like you who refuse to pay their fair share.\\n\\nLet’s talk about that podcast, too. You sat down with Scott Disick, the human embodiment of apathy and excess, and made it sound like a public service. A masterclass in what, exactly? How to coast through life as an empty vessel? A tutorial on how to swindle airtime with nothing to say?\\n\\nAnd now, in the midst of chaos and calamity, you’re suddenly the voice of the people? Please. If there’s one thing that rivals your ignorance, it’s your audacity. The joke, Khloé, isn’t the Mayor of LA. The joke is the multi-millionaire moral crusader who preaches virtue from a jet stream and filters reality through an Instagram lens so warped it could bend light.\\n\\nIf there’s one thing more astounding than your ignorance, it’s your shameless audacity. The joke isn’t the Mayor. The joke is you, Khloé: the filtered, Photoshopped, tax-dodging messiah of misdirected outrage.\\n\\nIf Khloé wants to call someone a joke, perhaps she should take a good, long look in her Instagram mirror—filtered, of course.\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I have lived in San Diego all of my life and I have never had to evacuate from a fire before. I knew I should have had a go-bag, but never made one. I honestly thought “I live in the middle of Mission Valley, what are the chances.” Prepping for a wildfire was stupidly near the bottom of my list of worries. Even the LA fires didn’t seem to help me be motivated to be more prepared.\\n\\nToday completely humbled me. My family had a mandatory order to evacuate our place. I had time to frantically drive home, grab my cat, and important documents. But that was basically it. I evacuated my place thinking there was a chance I wouldn’t be back, especially because we are on the edge of a canyon/slope and how close the fire was. \\n\\nI’m still processing the experience. But I feel so thankful and I don’t know any firefighters directly. So I wanted to come here. SDFD (or any firefighters really) thank you for all you do, thank you for the sacrifice you make. It’s a terrifying experience that I am completely ill equipped to solve and I completely rely on your expertise. \\n\\nMy home is still here and my family is safely here. \\nI don’t really have the words, except from the bottom of my heart, thank you. \\n\\nAlso, PSA to everyone. MAKE A GO BAG. I was not prepared for how scattered brained I was when trying to grab stuff. Don’t leave it to chance, have a plan. \\n\\nP.S Any good/trustworthy fire department charities/donations? Please comment if you know one.',\n",
